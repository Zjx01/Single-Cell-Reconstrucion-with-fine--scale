# Single Cell Reconstrucion with fine scale
In this project, we fomulated semi-automatic neuron tracing software for precise 3D neuron reconstruction from 2D image stacks by integrating CNN prediction and Voxel-Scooping Tracing Algorithm, as shown in project pipeline below.

### Why we develop this pipeline?
Revealing the interplay between the structure and function of neuron cells is of crucial importance to understand the neural circuit formulation and facilitate subsequent analysis of brain information flow. Neuron reconstruction which traces the neuron structure from optical images serves as an essential way to investigate how the brain works at a cell level. Although many methods have been developed for neuron tracing, `accurate neuron tracing for neuron images with complicated structures or fuzzy neurites remains an unsolved difficulty`.Revealing the interplay between the structure and function of neuron cells is of crucial importance to understand the neural circuit formulation and facilitate subsequent analysis of brain information flow.
